# URLs and web addresses

In content for a general audience, use *address* rather than *URL*. In content for a technical audience, don't spell out *URL* on first mention. If you have a reason to spell out URL, use *uniform* *resource locator*.

Use *a,* not *an,* as an article preceding *URL*.

## References to specific sites and domains

Don't include *https://* in a URL. Include the protocol only if it's something other than HTTP, such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP).

* E.g. www.nordicsemi.com/products
* E.g. ftp://example.com/downloads/myfile.txt

The trailing slash at the end of a URL is optional. In most cases, leave it off. Never use a trailing slash in a URL that ends with a file name.

Most of the time, use lowercase for URLs, email addresses, and newsgroup addresses. 

To refer to an entire website or top-level domain, such as Nordicsei.com, omit *http://www* from the URL and capitalize only the first letter of the URL, even if the site name is capitalized differently.

## Grammar and formatting

Use *of* (not *for*) to describe the relationship of the word *URL* to a resource. Use the preposition *at* with the location of a specific address.

* E.g. Search results include the URL of the page.
* E.g. Learn more about Microsoft products and services at [www.nordicsemi.com](https://www.nordicsemi.com/).

If the reader might think the period at the end of a sentence is part of the URL, rewrite the sentence or set the URL off.

* E.g. Go to [nordicsemi.com/products](https://nordicsemi.com/products) to learn more about our product offerings.

Write brief but meaningful link text, using the title or a description of a page rather than a generic phrase like *click here*. In alt text for a graphic that links to another location, state clearly that the graphic is a link.

* E.g. (Alt text) Picture of a circuit board with PIN01 circled in red.
