# Trademarks

Nordic trademarks will be collected and maintained by marketing. See [Trademarks](https://nordicsemi.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MAR/pages/132941867/Trademarks) in their space for a complete list. For Nordic product names see [Product names](https://nordicsemi.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MAR/pages/132940950/Product+names). See also RMF pp. 188 - 193.

## Adding trademarks with conkeyref

We add trademarks to our documentation using conkeyref. Trademarksare listed in [Infocenter/keydef/terms.dita](https://projecttools.nordicsemi.no/bitbucket/projects/TECHDOC/repos/infocenter/browse/keydef/terms.dita). In our documentation, each occurrence of a third party product or company name should use the conkeyref instead of marking up the text.

## General guidelines

In principle, trade names and trademarks do not need to have any trademark symbol used with them. We use it for those organizations we have a relationship with as a courtesy.

A relationship means:

* Any third party components we use on a PCB board (for example dev kit) or with our ICs.
* Protocols that we have strong links to the organizations that run them i.e., ANT+ and Bluetooth.
