# Slashes

When necessary, differentiate between a *slash* for URLs and a *backslash* for servers and folders.

When you instruct customers to enter a slash, always include the spelled-out term (*backslash* or *slash*) first, followed by the symbol in parentheses.

## Use a slash

Use a slash in the following situations.

| Situation | Examples |
|-----------|----------|
| **To imply a combination**</br> Capitalize the word after the slash if the word before the slash is capitalized. | client/server</br> TCP/IP</br> Use the on/off switch. |
| **To separate parts of an internet address**</br> Use two slashes after the protocol name. | `ftp://example.com/downloads` |
| **In server, folder, and file names** | `\\\\mslibrary\\catalog\\collect.doc` |
| **Between the numerator and denominator of fractions in equations that occur in text** | a/x + b/y = 1</br>x + 2/3(y) = m |

## Don't use a slash

**Do not** use a slash in the following situations.

| Situation | Incorrect | Correct  |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **As a substitute for *or***</br> If the UI uses a slash in this way, follow the interface in describing the label, but use *or* to describe the action in text. | Select Automatic trapping to **add/remove** a check mark. | Select Automatic trapping to **add or remove** a check mark.||
