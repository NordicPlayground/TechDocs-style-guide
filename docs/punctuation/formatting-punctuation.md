# Formatting punctuation

In general, format all punctuation in the same font style as the main content of a sentence or phrase. Format parentheses and brackets in the same font style as the main text.

| Situation | Examples |
|-----------|----------|
| Format parentheses and brackets in the same font style as the main text. | Open any Office app and select **File** > **Account**. In Outlook, select **File** > **Office Account**. |

In instructions that reference elements such as commands, options, keywords, placeholders, hyperlinks, pop-up text, and user input:

| Situation | Examples |
|-----------|----------|
| If the punctuation is part of the element, format the punctuation the same as the element. | Enter **Balance due:** in cell A14. |
| If the punctuation is not part of the element, format the punctuation the same as the main text. | On the **Insert** menu, go to **Pictures**, and then select **From File**. |
