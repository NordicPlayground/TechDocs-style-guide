# Semicolons

A semicolon is a punctuation mark used mainly in a coordinating function between major sentence elements such as independent clauses of a compound sentence.

Avoid using semicolons. Simplify the sentence by breaking it into multiple sentences or a list.

## Use a semicolon

Use a semicolon in the following situations.

|-----------|----------|
| **Between two independent clauses that aren't joined by a conjunction.** | Select **Options**; then select **Automatic backups** |
| **Between contrasting statements that aren't joined by a conjunction.** | What’s considered powerful changes over time; today’s advanced feature might be commonplace tomorrow |
