# Square brackets

Square brackets are not substitutes for parentheses. To preserve their unique meaning, construct sentences in a way that minimizes the grammatical need for square brackets.

## Use square brackets

Use square brackets in the following situations.

| Situation | Examples |
|-----------|----------|
| **Within parenthetic text**</br> Use square brackets to insert a parenthetic word or phrase into material that is already enclosed by parentheses. | Placing comments within a menu file often makes sense. (See page 154 of Advanced Skills, Revision A [May, 2009] for related information.)|
| **In optional command-line entries**</br> Use to set off an optional part of a command line. | date [yymmddhhmm]|
