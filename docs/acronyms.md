# Acronyms

Acronyms and abbreviations can have an adverse effect on clarity, voice, and SEO. Although some acronyms are widely understood and preferred to the spelled-out term, others aren't well known or are familiar only to a specific group of customers.

In machine-translated content, be careful with acronyms that form common English words, like *RAM.* If the acronym appears outside of the parentheses and without the spelled-out version, it might be translated incorrectly.

## Don't create acronyms from product or feature names

Always spell out Nordic product and feature names.

## Only use common acronyms

Only use acronyms that your audience is familiar with. The [Glossary](glossary.md) has guidelines for many common acronyms, and some acronyms are so widely used that they're in *[The American Heritage Dictionary](https://ahdictionary.com/).*

## Spell out acronyms for clarity

If you have to use an acronym, also spell out the term for clarity. In general, include the acronym in parentheses following the spelled-out term. On subsequent mentions in the same article, page, or screen, you can use the acronym without spelling it out.

E.g. **Conversation as a platform (CaaP)** has the potential to make booking a flight as easy as sending a text message. Developers are also looking to **CaaP** to make computing more accessible to users of all abilities.

Some acronyms, like *USB, FAQ,* and *URL,* are more well known than the spelled-out term. Don't spell out the term if the acronym is listed in *[The American Heritage Dictionary](https://ahdictionary.com/)*.

## Don't introduce acronyms that are used just once

If an acronym will appear only once in your content, just spell out the term. Don't introduce it in parentheses after the spelled-out version.

**Exception** It's OK to use both the spelled-out term and the acronym if both are needed for SEO, even if the acronym is used only once.

## Avoid acronyms in headings

Avoid using an acronym for the first time in a title or heading, unless it's a keyword that you need to place in the title or heading for SEO. If the first use of the acronym is in a title or heading, introduce the acronym (in parentheses, following the spelled-out term) in the following body text.

## Lowercase the spelled-out term

Lowercase all words in the spelled-out form of an acronym except for proper nouns. The names of many protocols and specifications are considered proper nouns and are capitalized when spelled out.

E.g. infrastructure as a service (IaaS)  
E.g. dynamic-link library (DLL)<br>High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI)

## Use *a* or *an,*

Use *a* or *an,* depending on pronunciation. Which article (*a* or *an*) you use depends on whether you pronounce the acronym like a word or pronounce each letter.

**Examples:**

* a DLL
* an ISP
* a URL
* an SQL database

## Add *s* to make an acronym plural

Form the plural of an acronym like you would any other noun. If the acronym stands for a singular noun, add a lowercase *s* to make it plural. If an acronym stands for a plural noun, don’t add an *s.*

E.g. three APIs  
E.g. Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC)

## Avoid the possessive form

Unless an acronym refers to a person or an organization, avoid using the possessive form.

**Examples:**

* the IDE enhancements  
* the purpose of the FAQ  
* the CEO’s blog
