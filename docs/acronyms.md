# Acronyms and abbreviations

Acronyms and abbreviations can affect clarity, tone, and SEO. Some are widely recognized, while others are known only to niche audiences. Always consider whether using an acronym enhances clarity for your target audience.

**What is an acronym?**
An acronym is an abbreviation formed from the initial letters of other words and pronounced as a word (for example, 'SDFW' for Secure Domain Firmware). Use acronyms carefully to maintain clarity for your readers.

In machine-translated content, avoid using acronyms that are also common English words, like *RAM*, as they may be translated incorrectly without context.

## Avoid creating acronyms from product or feature names

Always spell out Nordic Semiconductor product and feature names in full. This ensures consistency and clarity, especially for readers unfamiliar with specific products.

**Example:**
Instead of abbreviating "Nordic Secure Partition Manager" as NSPM, write it in full to avoid confusion.

## Only use widely recognized acronyms

Use acronyms only if they are widely recognized by your audience. Refer to the [Glossary](glossary.md) for guidelines on commonly accepted acronyms. If an acronym is listed in *[The American Heritage Dictionary](https://ahdictionary.com/)*, it can be used without further explanation. Always check if an acronym is listed in official internal documentation before using it.

## Spell out acronyms for clarity

Spell out all technical terms before using an acronym. Do not assume prior knowledge of any acronym, especially for technical terms. Use the acronym by itself only after it has been defined.

**Example:** **nRF Connect SDK** provides Secure Domain Firmware (SDFW) to ensure secure boot and maintain firmware integrity in IoT devices. Developers can leverage **SDFW** to enhance the security and resilience of Nordic Semiconductor products against potential threats.

Some acronyms, such as *USB, FAQ,* and *URL,* are so well known that they do not require spelling out. However, always consider your audience and the context to decide if this is appropriate.

## Avoid introducing acronyms used only once

If an acronym appears only once in your content, spell out the term instead. Introducing an acronym for a single use adds unnecessary complexity and may confuse readers.

**Exception**: For SEO purposes, you may use both the spelled-out term and the acronym together, but do this sparingly to avoid clutter. Avoid "alphabet soup" by minimizing back-to-back acronyms in a sentence.

## Avoid using acronyms in headings

Avoid using an acronym in a heading unless absolutely necessary for SEO. Instead, spell out the term in full. Acronyms in headings can reduce readability, especially for non-technical audiences. If an acronym's first occurrence must be in a heading, provide the full term in parentheses in the subsequent body text.

## Capitalize or lowercase the spelled-out term appropriately

Lowercase all words in the spelled-out form of an acronym, except for proper nouns. Capitalize the names of protocols, specifications, and official terms, as they are considered proper nouns.

**Examples:**

* Peripheral Resource System (PRS)
* Secure Partition Manager (SPM)

## Use *a* or *an* based on pronunciation

Always base the choice of *a* or *an* on the pronunciation of the acronym. If the acronym begins with a vowel sound, use *an*. If it begins with a consonant sound, use *a*.

**Examples:**

* an nRF52840 SoC
* a BLE connection
* an SDFW feature
* an LTE-M network

For acronyms like *SQL*, use *an* if pronouncing it as 'ess-cue-el', but use *a* if pronounced as 'sequel'. Avoid using acronyms that create awkward phrasing when paired with *a* or *an*. If clarity suffers, consider spelling out the term.

## Pluralize acronyms correctly

To make an acronym plural, add a lowercase *s*. Do not use an apostrophe to form the plural.

**Examples:**

* three nRF Connect SDK releases
* multiple nRF52840 DKs

If the acronym stands for a term that is already plural, do not add an *s*. Ensure readers can clearly distinguish between single and plural references.

## Avoid possessive forms of acronyms

Avoid possessive forms of acronyms to improve clarity. Rephrase sentences to avoid ambiguity.

**Examples:**

* Instead of "the CPU’s efficiency," write "the efficiency of the CPU."
* Instead of "the BLE’s specifications," write "the specifications of the BLE."
* the nRF Connect SDK updates
* the purpose of the SDFW documentation
* the developer's guide

## Special cases for acronyms

In internal documentation or communication, acronyms that are well-known within the organization but not externally should still be spelled out for clarity if the content is intended for a wider audience.

## Acronyms in graphics and tables

When using acronyms in figure captions or tables, spell out the term in a note or include a legend if it may not be widely recognized.

**Example:**
In a table header: "nRF52840 Development Kit (DK)" should be spelled out in a note or included in a legend for clarity.

## Exceptions to avoiding acronyms

In technical specifications or space-constrained elements like tables or diagrams, acronyms may be used more freely, but their definitions should be provided elsewhere in the document to ensure reader understanding.
