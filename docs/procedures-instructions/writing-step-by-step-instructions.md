# Writing step-by-step instructions

Follow these guidelines to help you create clear, easy-to-follow instructions, whether you're writing simple, single-step procedures or complex
procedures that consist of multiple steps.

## Complex procedures

Complex instructions often consist of multiple steps formatted as a numbered list. For multiple-step procedures in numbered lists:

* Format procedures consistently so customers can find them easily by scanning.

* Use the heading to tell customers what the instructions will help them do. Choose one phrasing style for the headings, and write them all the same way (in parallel structure).

    * E.g. To add an account
    * E.g. Add an account

* Use a separate numbered entry for each step. It's OK to combine short steps that occur in the same place in the UI.

* Include actions that finalize a step, such as OK or Apply buttons.

* Use complete sentences with verbs in the imperative form.

* Use consistent sentence structures. For example, always use a phrase when you need to tell the customer where to start. The rest of the time, start each sentence with a verb.
    * E.g. On the ribbon, go to the **Design** tab.  
    Open Photos.  
    For **Alignment**, choose **Left**.

* Capitalize the first word in each step.

* Use a period after each step.
     * **Exception:** When instructing customers to type input that doesn't include end punctuation, don’t use a period. Try to format the text so that the user input appears on a new line.

* Limit a procedure to seven or fewer steps. Try to fit all the steps on the same screen.

## Single-step procedures

If you're using a consistent format for step-by-step instructions, use the same format for single-step instructions, but replace the number with a bullet.

## Tips for writing steps

Make sure the customer knows where the action should take place before you describe the action.

* If the instruction appears in the same UI where the action occurs, it’s usually not necessary to provide location details.

* If you need to make sure the customer begins in the right place, provide a brief phrase at the beginning of the step.
     * E.g. On the **Design** tab, select **Header Row**.
  
* If there’s a chance of confusion, provide an introductory step.
    * E.g. On the ribbon, go to the **Design** tab.

## Instructions with right angle brackets

Abbreviate simple sequences by using right angle brackets. Include a space before and after each bracket, and don't make the brackets bold.

* E.g. Select **Accounts** > **Other accounts** > **Add an account**.

Screen readers may skip over brackets and read instructions such as **Menu** > **Go To** > **Folders** as *Menu Go To Folders,* which might confuse customers. Check with an accessibility expert before using this approach.
