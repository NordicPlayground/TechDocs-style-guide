# Writing for all abilities

## Put the person first

In general, refer to a person who has a kind of disability, not a disabled person.

## Write brief, meaningful, and focused text

Be especially clear and concise in instructions for product setup, basic features, input methods, and accessibility features.

## Lead with what matters most

Leading with the most important information helps readers know immediately where to focus their attention.

## Write short and simple paragraphs

Keep paragraphs short and sentence structure simple. Aim for one verb per sentence. Read text aloud and imagine it spoken by a screen reader.

## Use parallel writing structures for similar things

For example, use singular nouns for each top-level heading. Or, use a verb to start each item in a list.

## Spell out words like *and, plus,* and *about.*

Screen readers can misread text that uses special characters like the plus sign (+) and tilde (~).

## Write brief link text

Write brief but meaningful link text. Links should make sense without the surrounding text.

## Distinguish link text visually

Use redundant visual cues, such as both color and underline.

## Don’t force line breaks

Don’t force line breaks (also known as hard returns) within sentences and paragraphs. They may not work well in resized windows or with enlarged text.

## Emphasize important points

Emphasize important points visually and stylistically. Lists, headings, and tables reinforce relationships between concepts. Provide summary information about the table, and use concise and specific column headings.

## Use heading styles

Use heading styles instead of text formatting. Heading levels communicate the hierarchy of content.

## Don’t use directional terms only

Don’t use directional terms as the only clue to location. *Left, right, up, down, above,* and *below* aren’t very useful for people who use screen-reading software. If you must use a directional term, provide additional text about the location, such as *in the* ***Save As*** *dialog box, on the* ***Standard*** *toolbar,* or *in the title bar.*

## Document alternate input methods

In product documentation, document all supported modes of interaction, input commands, and keyboard shortcuts. Include mice, keyboards, voice recognition devices, game controllers, gestures, and other interaction modes.

## Use generic verbs for all input methods

Use generic verbs that apply to all input methods and devices. Avoid verbs like *click* (mouse) and *swipe* (touch) that don't make sense with some alternative input methods used for accessibility.
