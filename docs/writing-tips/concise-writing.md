# Concise writing

To improve readability and comprehension, choose your words wisely and use them consistently. Concise, clear sentences save space, are easy to understand, and facilitate scanning.

## Write short, simple sentences

Punctuating a sentence with more than a few commas and end punctuation usually indicates a complex sentence. Consider rewriting it or breaking it into multiple sentences. Write sentences that use standard word order (that is, subject + verb + object) whenever possible.

### Replace complex sentences

Replace complex sentences and paragraphs with lists and tables.

### Avoid linking more than three phrases

Avoid linking more than three phrases or clauses by using coordinate conjunctions such as *and,* *or,* or *but.* Better yet, avoid linking more than two.

### Choose simple verbs without modifiers

| **Use this** |         **Not this**          |
|--------------|-------------------------------|
|     use      |     utilize, make use of      |
|    remove    | extract, take away, eliminate |
|     tell     |       inform, let know        |

### Don’t use two or three words when one will do

| **Use this** |        **Not this**        |
|--------------|----------------------------|
|      to      | in order to, as a means to |
|     also     |        in addition         |
|   connect    |   establish connectivity   |

## Use one word for a concept

Use one word for a concept, and use it consistently. Avoid using synonyms to refer to the same concept or feature. Don’t use the same word to refer to multiple concepts or features.

### Choose words that have one clear meaning

|                    **Use this**                     |                   **Not this**                    |
|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| *Because* you created the table, you can change it. | *Since* you created the table, you can change it. |
