# Capitalization

Use sentence-style capitalization for most titles and headings. This means capitalizing only the first word and using lowercase for the rest, except for proper nouns like brands, products, and services.

## Sentence-style capitalization guidelines

* Capitalize the first word of any sentence, heading, title, UI label (such as a button or checkbox name), or standalone phrase.
* Always capitalize proper nouns. For more on proper nouns, see [Nouns and pronouns](grammar/nouns-pronouns.md).
* Use lowercase for all other words.
* Always capitalize the first word of a new sentence. Avoid starting sentences with words that are always lowercase.
* Capitalize the first letter of technical abbreviations, acronyms, and units of measurement after spelling them out at least once. For example, write "Central Processing Unit (CPU)" initially, then use "CPU" afterward.
* Once an acronym is defined, use only the acronym throughout the rest of the document.
  * Example: CPU.
* Avoid using plural forms of abbreviations and acronyms unless strictly necessary.

### Exceptions

| Situation | Examples |
|-----------|----------|
| Proper nouns, including brand, product, and service names, are always capitalized. If a title or heading includes a colon, capitalize the first word after it only if it is a proper noun. | The nRF Connect SDK helps developers create solutions efficiently. |
| Titles of blog posts, documentation articles, and press releases use sentence-style capitalization. | Develop with nRF Connect: Best practices for IoT projects |
| Figure captions and table captions should use sentence-style capitalization, ensuring consistency between captions and references in the text. | |
| Capitalize the first word after a colon if it introduces a complete sentence. | The following should be considered: Avoid unnecessary repetition. |
| Capitalize the first word after closing quotation marks if it begins a new sentence. | "Save your work frequently," the instructor said. |

## Lists, figures, and tables

* Use sentence-style capitalization for bullet points, numbered items in lists, and table headers.
* Maintain consistency between figure/table captions and references in the text.
* For continuation bullet points, avoid ending punctuation unless necessary for clarity.
* Use sentence-style capitalization for the terms "figure" and "table" when referring to specific items.
  * Example: See figure 3 for details.
* Use sentence-style capitalization for headers in appendices, indexes, and glossaries.
  * Example: "appendix A: hardware reference" or "glossary of terms."

## Headings with symbols or special characters

* Retain symbols, special characters, and mathematical notation in headings. Apply sentence-style capitalization to all other words.
* When a heading includes symbols, special characters, or mathematical notation, retain the original formatting.
  * Example: "Understanding the @ sign" or "5G network overview."

## Technical terms and abbreviations

* Spell out technical terms (such as acronyms and abbreviations) at first occurrence, followed by the abbreviation in parentheses.
  * Example: Secure Partition Manager (SPM).
* Avoid plural forms of abbreviations and acronyms unless strictly necessary.
* When using an acronym in possessive form, add `'s` directly.
  * Example: The nRF5340's performance.
* Capitalize acronyms like "GHz" and "MHz" in numerical contexts, and do the same for units of measurement when used with numbers.
  * Example: "256 kB of RAM."
* Avoid using command names or technical terms in capitalized form unless required. For example, keep `nrfutil` as is without capitalization.
* Use lowercase for file names, directory paths, or command options unless explicitly required.
  * Example: `~/Documents/myfile.txt` should keep its original case.
* Follow language conventions for code snippets or commands in running text.
  * Example: "To create a directory, use the `mkdir` command."
* When a brand name is part of a hyphenated compound, only capitalize the brand name unless the second word is a proper noun.
  * Example: Nordic-certified technician.
* Maintain the original capitalization for brand names, such as CamelCase or internal capitalization, even when used within a sentence or heading.
  * Example: "nRF Connect SDK should retain CamelCase."

## Cross-references and UI labels

* Use sentence-style capitalization consistently for cross-references and UI labels.
  * Example: Refer to "mechanics of writing" and click the "save as draft" button.

## Commands and software elements in headings

* Keep commands or software elements in headings in their original case. Avoid modifying them for stylistic reasons.
  * Example: "Using the `nrfutil` command" instead of "Using the NrfUtil Command".

## Capitalization in parentheses

* If a parenthetical statement forms a complete sentence, capitalize the first word and place the punctuation inside the closing parenthesis.
  * Example: (This is a complete sentence.)
* If the parenthetical statement is not a complete sentence, do not capitalize the first word.
  * Example: (for example, using abbreviations).

## Quotation marks within a sentence

* If a complete sentence is quoted within a sentence, retain its original capitalization. If quoting a partial phrase, follow the sentence's capitalization.
  * Example: She said, "Be careful when proceeding," and continued her work.
  * Example: He described it as a "groundbreaking discovery" in his presentation.
* If a partial quoted phrase begins a new sentence, use sentence-style capitalization.
  * Example: "nRF52840 module performance" was the topic of discussion.

## References to specific versions or editions

* Use sentence-style capitalization for specific versions or editions, only capitalizing proper nouns.
  * Example: "version 2.0," "edition 2023," or "nRF Connect SDK version 1.9.0."

## Multilingual content capitalization

* When including non-English words or phrases, retain their original capitalization rules as per their language conventions.
  * Example: In Norwegian, "Trådløs teknologi" retains its noun capitalization, while in French, "intelligence artificielle" remains lowercase.

## Hyphenated words and compound adjectives in headings

* Use sentence-style capitalization for hyphenated compounds in headings and body text, capitalizing only proper nouns.
  * Example: Power-On/Off switch, self-correcting errors.
* Use lowercase for compound adjectives in body text unless they include a proper noun.
  * Example: "Client-server architecture."
* Avoid ambiguous capitalization involving gerunds and participles.
  * Example: Use "user-defined variables" rather than "User-Defined Variables" unless in a title context.

## Avoid unnecessary capitalization

Avoid the following forms of unnecessary capitalization:

* Do not use all uppercase for emphasis.
* Do not use all lowercase as a stylistic choice.
* Do not use internal capitalization (for example, *AutoScale* or *e-Book*) unless it is part of a brand name.
* Do not capitalize the spelled-out form of an acronym unless it is a proper noun.
