# Numbers

Be consistent in your use of numbers. When you write about numbers used in examples or UI, duplicate them exactly as they appear in the UI. In all other content, follow the guidelines below.

## Numerals vs. words

### Use a numeral

Use a numeral instead of a word in the following situations.

| Situation | Examples |
|-----------|----------|
| In body text, use numerals for 10 or greater, but spell out whole numbers from zero through nine. <br /> If space is limited in tables or UI, it is ok to use numerals for zero through nine. | 10 screen savers <br /> five databases <br /> zero probability <br /> 7,990,000 |
| If one item requires a numeral, use numerals for all the other items of that type. | One article has 16 pages, one has 7 pages, and the third has only 5 pages. |
| When two numbers that refer to different things must appear together, use a numeral for one and spell out the other. | fifteen 20-page articles |
| Measurements of distance, temperature, volume, size, weight, pixels, points, etc. | 3 feet, 5 inches <br /> 80 × 80 pixels <br /> 0.75 grams <br /> 3 centimeters|
| A number the customer is directed to enter. | Enter *5*. |
| A round number of 1 million or more. | 7 million |
| Coordinates of tables or worksheets and numbered sections of documents. | row 3, column 4 <br /> Chapter 10 <br /> Step 1 |
| When talking about dimensions like tile sizes, screen resolutions, and paper sizes, use the multiplication sign (×) with a space before and after the sign. <br /> When talking aboth other dimensions, spell out *by*. | 4 × 4 tile <br /> 8.5&quot; × 11&quot; paper <br /> 1280 × 1024 |
| Percentages, no matter how small, use a numeral plus *percent*. </br > Use *percentage* when you don't specify a quantity. | At least 50 percent of your system resources should be available.|

### Use a word

Use a word instead of a numeral in the following situations.

| Situation | Examples |
|-----------|----------|
| For days, weeks, and other units of time, spell out zero through nine and use numerals for 10 or greater. | seven years <br /> 28 days <br /> 12 hrs |
| For time of day, include *AM* or *PM.* after the numerical time. <br /> Include the time zone if you're discussing an event. <br /><br /> **Exception:** Don't use numerals for *12:00*. Use *noon* or *midnight* instead. | 10:45 AM <br /> 6:30 PM <br /> The meeting is at noon. <br /> The event starts at 5:00 PM CST. |
| Don't start a sentence with a numeral. <br /> Add a modifier before the number, or spell the number out if you can't rewrite the sentence. <br /> It is ok to start list items with numerals—use your judgment. | More than 10 apps are included. <br /> Eleven apps are included. |
| For days, weeks, and other units of time, spell out zero through nine and use numerals for 10 or greater. | seven years <br /> 28 days <br /> 12 hrs |

## Commas in numbers

### Use commas

| Situation | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Use commas in numbers that have four or more digits.| $1,024 <br />1,093 MB |
| When designating years, pixels, or baud, use commas only when the number has *five or more digits*. | 1920 × 1080 pixels <br /> 10,240 × 4320 pixels <br /> 9600 baud <br /> 14,400 baud |

### Don't use commas
| Situation | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Don't use commas in page numbers, addresses, or after the decimal point in decimal fractions. | page 1091 <br /> 1.06377 units |

## Numbers in dates

| Situation | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Use a numeral to describe a date, not ordinal numbers such as *October twenty-eighth*. | June 1 </br> October 28 |
| Always spell out the name of the month. <br /> The positions of the month and day vary by country. | 6/12/2017 might be June 12, 2017 or December 6, 2017 and creates confusion. |

## Negative numbers

| Situation | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Form a negative number with an [*en dash*](punctuation/dashes-and-hyphens.md#en-dashes), not a hyphen. | –79 |

## Compound numbers

| Situation | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Hyphenate compound numbers when they are spelled out. | twenty-five fonts <br /> the twenty-first day |

## Fractions and decimals

### Use fractions and decimals

Express fractions in words, as symbols, or as decimals, whichever is most appropriate. In tables, align decimals on the decimal point.

| Situation | Example |
| --- | --- |
| For decimal fractions less than one, add a zero before the decimal point. | 0.5 cm <br /> enter .75 |
| Hyphenate spelled-out fractions. <br /> Connect the numerator and denominator with a hyphen unless either already contains a hyphen. | two-thirds completed <br /> three sixty-fourths |
| In measurements where the unit of measure is spelled out, use the plural form when the quantity is a decimal fraction. <br /> Use the singular form only when the quantity is 1. | 0.5 inches <br /> 0 inches <br /> 1 inch <br /> 5 inches |

### Don't use fractions and decimals

| Situation | Example |
| --- | --- |
| In general, don't use numerals separated by a slash to express fractions. <br /> When an equation occurs in text, it is ok to use a slash between the numerator and the denominator. | ½ + ½ = 1 |

## Ordinal numbers

### Use ordinal numbers

| Situation | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Always spell out ordinal numbers. | the first row <br /> the twenty-first anniversary |

### Don't use ordinal numbers

| Situation | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Don't use ordinal numbers for dates. | June first |
| Don't add -ly to an ordinal number | firstly or secondly |

## Ranges of numbers

| Situation | Example |
| --- | --- |
| In most cases, use *from* and *through* to describe a range of numbers. <br /> **Exception:** Don't use *from* before a range indicated by an [*en dash*](punctuation/dashes-and-hyphens.md#en-dashes) | from 9 through 17|
| Use an [*en dash*](punctuation/dashes-and-hyphens.md#en-dashes) in a range of pages or where space is an issue, such as in tables and UI. | 2016–2020 <br /> pages 112–120 |
| Use *to* in a range of times. | 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM |

## Abbreviations of Numbers

| Situation | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Spell out *thousand*, *million*, and *billion*, or use the entire number. | Fabrikam, Inc., employs more than 65,000 people.<br />Total cost to the enterprise: 300,000 hours and $30 million per year |

In UI, avoid the abbreviations unless space is too limited to spell out the number.  
If you must use the abbreviations, follow these guidelines:

* Capitalize *K*, *M*, and *B*.
* Don't put a space between the number and the abbreviation.
* Use the decimal form of a number only if it really will save space. In particular, avoid the use of a decimal with *K*. For example, 8.21K has the same number of characters as 8,210.
