# Final publishing review

Before submitting documentation for review, consider the following.

## Send a clear message

Review the project brief and customer insights one last time.

* Is the objective clear?
* Is the value proposition easily identifiable?
* Are key messages and benefits clear?

## Get a second opinion

Find someone completely removed from the work to offer feedback and act as the customer. No matter how well you write, a second set of eyes always offers a new perspective.

Don’t take suggestions personally—keep an open mind and be flexible to new ways to get the results you want. If something trips up your reviewer, get rid of it, no matter how much you like it.

## Read your work aloud

Reading each sentence aloud one at a time can help you identify run-on sentences or confusing statements when you hear them spoken.

## Read only the headings and first sentence

Read only the headings, and then only the first sentence of every paragraph. Do they tell a story? Are there gaps? Repeated ideas?

## Check for keywords in titles and headings

Titles and headings help readers scan and help search engines find your content. Make sure you include relevant keywords in the first few words. While you’re at it, read your first sentence to see if it will make sense as a search engine description.

## Remove unnecessary and redundant elements

Try removing words, sentences, paragraphs, headings, even entire sections. If you don't miss it, leave it out. It’s good for your opening paragraph to summarize the piece at a high level, but don’t repeat phrases verbatim, or include tips or notes found later in the text.

## Pay attention to the spell checker

Those squiggly lines will help you eliminate a lot of errors. But spell checkers can’t think. It’s up to you to check each suggestion. Otherwise you might end up saying *manger* where you meant *manager.*

## Take a break

Leave the finished piece alone for a day. Read it again tomorrow—you may see things you missed.

## Evaluate the voice and personality

Before you call it done, read it one final time. Does it sound clear and neutral?
