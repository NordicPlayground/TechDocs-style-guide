# Content planning

Great content starts with a plan that begins with these questions.

## Who is your audience?

This could be broad—developers, for example—but defining your audience more specifically will help you refine your plan.

* Is your audience writing software? Apps? IT tools? Games?
* Are they hobbyists, full-time developers, or IT pros who write code?
* What development software do they use?

## What do they want to accomplish?

Few customers come to us to see what’s new. Understanding why they come will help you satisfy their needs.

* Are they deciding whether to buy your product?
* Setting up a new computer?
* Learning new software?
* Preparing for a migration?
* Planning for network security?
* Is their need urgent?

## What is your business goal for providing the content?

Although the customer’s goals are paramount, every communication has a business reason, too.

* Are you building enthusiasm for an upcoming product launch?
* Establishing a competitive position in the marketplace?
* Documenting an out-of-band release?
* Providing support content to accelerate migration?

## Do you have time or budget constraints?

If time is of the essence, content you can create quickly might be best. The budget and the availability of an agency or specialized resources, like illustrators, designers, and video producers, will help you determine what content options are realistic.

## What kind of content best meets the customer's needs and business goals?

If the concepts are hard to explain, video or infographics could be helpful. If the customer is preparing for a major project, maybe they need checklists and sample project plans, or a pricing calculator. For breaking news, tweets or a strategic blog post might be the best approach.

## How will the customer find the content?

What search terms will the customer use? Plan for search keyword optimization; links back to your content; and promotion through home pages, blogs, newsletters, events, third-party sites, communities, and social media if appropriate.

## Where will the customer look for information?

Part of knowing your customers is understanding where they go for information. If they have a problem, they may look to product documentation, DevZone, or an expert community. For training, DevAcademy or a video platform like YouTube might be their source. For tips and tricks, maybe it’s social media and blogs.

## What devices will the customer use to experience the content?

Laptops? Tablets? Phones? All of those? Plan for a great experience across devices the customer is likely to use.

## Will the content be translated or localized?

If so, plan your content to streamline those processes and contain costs.

## How will you measure success?

Planning for specific objectives up front will help you create content that meets them.

* Do you have numeric targets for views, clicks, or downloads?
* Goals for mentions or backlinks?
* Targets for lead generation?
