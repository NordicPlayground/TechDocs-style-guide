# General formatting

## Formatting titles

Follow these conventions for formatting titles.

| **Titles** | **Convention** | **Example** |
|---|---|--|
| **Chapters and sections of books** | Usually sentence-style capitalization. Enclose in quotation marks. | See Chapter 9, "Extending forms." <br /> See “Managing your contacts” |
| **White papers** | Title-style capitalization. | Backup and Recovery Overview for Azure Customers|
| **Blog titles** | Title-style capitalization. In references, don't enclose the title in quotation marks. | The Official Nordic Blog |
| **Titles of blog posts, web articles, and press releases** | Sentence-style capitalization. It's OK to use title-style capitalization to highlight a blog or article title in a tweet. If a reference to a blog post, article, or press release isn't linked, enclose the title in quotation marks. | Securing your preproduction environment in the cloud <br /> For information about the latest scam tactics, see "Tech support scams are a growing problem" on DevZone. |

## Use sentence-style capitalization

In sentence-style capitalization, you capitalize only the first word of a sentence or phrase and proper nouns.

e.g. This sentence and the subhead of this section both use sentence-style capitalization.

### Don't use all-uppercase

Although all-uppercase text is used occasionally on webpages, in advertising, and in other marketing communications, don’t use it in text. A mix of uppercase and lowercase characters gives words familiar shapes that help readers scan more efficiently. All-uppercase text just looks like a rectangle, so it’s harder to
read.

e.g. THIS SENTENCE IS ALL UPPERCASE AND NOT VERY EASY TO READ, DON’T YOU AGREE?

### Don't use all-lowercase

Don’t use all-lowercase text. Capital letters help readers recognize that a new section or thought is beginning. All-lowercase text
takes away that helpful cue.

e.g. this sentence is all lowercase. or is it a sentence? it's hard to tell with no capital letters.

To learn more about capitalization, see [Capitalization](~/capitalization.md).

## Use left alignment

Left-aligned text has an even left margin and an erratic (ragged) right margin. Don't center text.

Avoid these awkward situations in text:

* Orphans, which occur when the first line of a paragraph appears by itself at the bottom of a page or column
* Widows, which occur when the last line of a paragraph contains only one word or appears alone on the next page or column
* Lines that end with hyphens

| **To** | **Do this** |
|--------|-------------|
| Keep a hyphenated word from breaking at the end of a line | Insert a nonbreaking hyphen by pressing **Ctrl+Shift+_**. |
| Keep the last word of a paragraph with the word that precedes it | Insert a nonbreaking space by pressing **Ctrl+Shift+Space**. |
| Control widows and orphans in Word | Select a paragraph formatted with Normal style. On the context menu, select **Styles > Apply Styles**. In the **Apply Styles** pane, select **Modify**. Select **Format > Paragraph**. On the **Line and page breaks** tab, select **Widow/Orphan control**. |

## Don't compress line spacing

The amount of vertical space between lines of text in a paragraph, called line spacing, can help or hinder reading. Adequate line spacing helps readers find their way from the end of one line to the beginning of the next.

If you’re using a template, don’t change the line spacing. If you’re not, ask a designer for advice if you can.

If you need to modify line spacing later, change it in the styles, not in individual paragraphs, so spacing remains consistent throughout the content. Never reduce line spacing to fit more text on a slide or page. Edit the text instead.

| **Font size** | **Line spacing** |
|---------------|------------------|
| Body text (up to 14 points) | 120% minimum |
| Subheadings (14–36 points) | 110% minimum |
| Headings (36 points or larger) | 120% maximum |
