# Tables

Tables make complex information easier to understand by presenting it in a clear structure. Don't use a table
just to present a list of items that are similar. Use a list instead.

|             Tables are sometimes useful for       |                           Example                              |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Data or values                                    | Text formats and their associated HTML codes                   |
| Simple instructions                               | User interface actions and their associated keyboard shortcuts |
| Categories of things with examples                | SKUs and the products they include                             |
| Collections of things with two or more attributes | Event dates with times and locations                           |

## Content

Make sure the purpose of the table is clear with a table title or brief introduction if necessary.

Place information that identifies the contents of a row in the leftmost column of the table.

* For example, in a table that describes commands, put the command names in the left column.

Make entries in a table parallel.

* For example, make all the items within a column a noun or a phrase that starts with a verb.

* Use *Not applicable* or *None.* instead of leaving a cell blank .

| Cancello                | Cancels all pending input and output (I/O) operations that are issued by the calling thread for the specified file |
| CancelloEx              | Marks any outstanding I/O operations for the specified file handle                                                 |
| GetTempFileName         | Creates a name for a temporary file                                                                                |

## Header rows

Distinguish the text in the header row by making the font larger, bolder, or a different color.

Don’t organize a table so that the column heading forms a complete sentence when combined with the cell contents.

In long tables, make sure the header row is always visible. For example, on the web, use a fixed header row that stays in place during scrolling. Or, in a downloadable document, occasionally repeat the header row.

## Capitalization

Use sentence-style capitalization for the table title and each column heading.

Use sentence-style capitalization for the text in cells unless there’s a reason not to (for example, keywords that must be lowercase).

## Punctuation

If there’s text that introduces the table, it should be a complete sentence and end with a period, not a colon.

Don’t use ellipses at the end of column headings.

For the text in cells, use periods or other end punctuation only if the cells contain complete sentences or a mixture of fragments and sentences.
