# General formatting

The volume of content available to customers is overwhelming. Part of a writer's job is to help readers find what they need quickly, or recognize just as quickly when they're not where they need to be. Writing to facilitate scanning will help.

## Put important things first

Content on the first screen (also called *above the fold*) is the most likely to be read. Many readers won’t scroll further without a compelling reason. Keep it short, and lead with what’s most important to the customer. Keep in mind that what appears above the fold varies by device and screen resolution.

## Be brief, bold, and clear

Long spans of dense text are daunting and unapproachable to readers. Write short headings, short sentences, and short paragraphs that are easy to read—and more visually appealing.

1. Use short, simple words.
1. Get to the point.
1. Then stop.

## Establish content patterns

Consistent writing, design, and formatting create patterns, which help readers comprehend more efficiently. Apply these tactics throughout your content to create familiar landmarks for your readers:

* Lead with what's most important. Place important keywords near the beginning of headings, table entries, and paragraphs so they're easy to spot.

* Use text formatting consistently, such as using bold in procedures to identify UI labels.

* Apply the same sentence structures to similar information. For example, use prepositional phrases consistently in procedures to help customers navigate menus and dialog boxes. And use the same syntax for cross-references and other common content elements.

## Give paragraphs room—and keep them short

Short paragraphs help to break up long passages of text. Three to seven lines is about the right length for a paragraph. It’s also fine to have a single-line paragraph now and then.

## Formatting titles

Follow these conventions for formatting titles.

| **Titles** | **Convention** | **Example** |
|---|---|--|
| **Chapters and sections of books** | Usually sentence-style capitalization. Enclose in quotation marks. | See Chapter 9, "Extending forms." <br /> See “Managing your contacts” |
| **White papers** | Title-style capitalization. | Backup and Recovery Overview for Azure Customers|
| **Blog titles** | Title-style capitalization. In references, don't enclose the title in quotation marks. | The Official Nordic Blog |
| **Titles of blog posts, web articles, and press releases** | Sentence-style capitalization. It's OK to use title-style capitalization to highlight a blog or article title in a tweet. If a reference to a blog post, article, or press release isn't linked, enclose the title in quotation marks. | Securing your preproduction environment in the cloud <br /> For information about the latest scam tactics, see "Tech support scams are a growing problem" on DevZone. |

## Don't use all-uppercase or all-lowercase

Don't use all-uppercase or all-lowercase text in technical documentation. The mix of upper and lowercase characters helps users to clearly differentiate between words and sections.

* e.g. THIS SENTENCE IS ALL UPPERCASE AND NOT VERY EASY TO READ, DON’T YOU AGREE?
* e.g. this sentence is all lowercase. or is it a sentence? it's hard to tell with no capital letters.

## Use left alignment

Left-aligned text has an even left margin and an erratic (ragged) right margin. Don't center text.

Avoid these awkward situations in text:

* Orphans, which occur when the first line of a paragraph appears by itself at the bottom of a page or column
* Widows, which occur when the last line of a paragraph contains only one word or appears alone on the next page or column
* Lines that end with hyphens

| **To** | **Do this** |
|--------|-------------|
| Keep a hyphenated word from breaking at the end of a line | Insert a nonbreaking hyphen by pressing **Ctrl+Shift+_**. |
| Keep the last word of a paragraph with the word that precedes it | Insert a nonbreaking space by pressing **Ctrl+Shift+Space**. |
| Control widows and orphans in Word | Select a paragraph formatted with Normal style. On the context menu, select **Styles > Apply Styles**. In the **Apply Styles** pane, select **Modify**. Select **Format > Paragraph**. On the **Line and page breaks** tab, select **Widow/Orphan control**. |

## Responsive content

If you’re writing for the web, assume your content will be used on a variety of devices. Many websites today are *responsive*—that is, they reconfigure automatically based on the device in use. Assume your content will be viewed at small sizes.

### Keep it short

On mobile devices, write clearly and concisely to improve the readability on small screens. Short sentences, paragraphs, and one-line headings help accessibility.

### Use simple images, charts, and tables

Use simple content, concise images with alt text, and easily enlargeable infographics. Simplify charts and graphs with short labels and content. Limit table columns and keep cell text brief to fit mobile screens.

### Consider flow

As you create content, think about how it will flow on a 360-pixel screen. Typically, content on the right side of the page moves below content on the left side. Will the content still make sense?
