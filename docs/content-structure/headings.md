# Headings

Headings provide structure and visual reference, aiding content scanning. Use them consistently across all content types. Treat headings as an outline: top-level for major subjects, second-level for distinct subtopics within larger sections. Ensure headings are specific and introduce new topics in an interesting way. Avoid consecutive headings without intervening text. Skip subheadings if you are unable to identify at least two distinct topics.

## Writing headings

Use the following recommendations when writing headings.

### Use headings judiciously

One heading level is usually plenty for a page or two of content. For long content, you might need to use additional heading levels.

### Keep headings short and simple

Put the most important idea at the beginning. Be as specific as you can, and be even more detailed with lower-level headings. For example, a second-level heading should be more specific than a first-level heading.

### Use infinitive phrases

Use infinitive phrases such as *To create a heading,* for headings and titles related to tasks. For headings that aren't related to tasks, use a noun phrase such as *Headings*.

### Focus on what matters to customers

Focus on what matters to customers,** and choose words they'd use themselves. In most cases, don't talk about products, features, or commands in headings. Concentrate on what customers can achieve or what they need to know.

### Use parallel sentence structure

Use parallel sentence structure for all headings at the same level. For example, use noun phrases for first-level headings, verb phrases for second-level headings, and infinitive phrases for headings in instructions.

* E.g. **Prepare headings** (First-level heading)  
 *To create a heading...* (First sentence or second-level heading)

### Avoid most punctuation

* **Period** - Don't end headings with a period.
* **Question mark or an exclamation point** - can be used if it's needed for meaning, but these should be extreme exceptions.
    * E.g. *Not seeing what you want?* or *What can we help you find?*
* **Ampersands (&) or plus signs (+)** - avoid unless you're referring to UI that contains them or space is limited.
* **Hyphens** - in resized windows or mobile devices, they can result in awkward line breaks.
* Use *vs.,* not *v*. or *versus,* in headings.

## Formatting headings

### Use sentence-style capitalization for headings

That means that you capitalize the first word, any proper nouns, and the first word after a colon (if there is one). Everything else is lowercase.

**Examples:**

* Set up the deployment environment
* My account

### Break two-line headings carefully

Unless you're writing content for a responsive design (which breaks lines dynamically to fit the screen), break the heading in a way that makes sense and balances the length of the two lines. (Shift + Enter inserts a manual line break in many authoring tools.)

* Keep adjectives and prepositions with the words they modify.

* Keep hyphenated words and multiple-word proper nouns (such as *New York*) on the same line.

* Break after punctuation.

* Break naturally, at the end of a complete phrase, if possible.

* If you can't fit a headline on two lines, rewrite it.

### Use vertical spacing to make headings stand out

Headings typically have extra space above them and often less space below them. Close proximity between the heading and the text that follows it communicates to the reader that they're related. Heading spacing is built into heading styles in most templates. Use those styles to control spacing in a consistent way.

### Don't use extra line breaks

Don't use extra line breaks to increase heading spacing. In responsive web design, the layout and screen elements (including headings) adjust to the screen size automatically, whether they're viewed on mobile devices, tablets, laptops, or desktops. Extra line breaks might detract from the content appearance on mobile devices.
