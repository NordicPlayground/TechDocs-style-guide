# Word choice

To improve readability and comprehension, choose your words wisely and use them consistently. If you mean the same thing, use the same word.

## What to do

### Omit unnecessary adverbs—words

Omit unnecessary adverbs—words that describe how, when, or where. Unless they're important to the meaning of a statement, leave them out.

Examples:

* quite
* very
* quickly
* easily
* effectively


### Be careful with words that can be both nouns and verbs

Use words that can be both nouns and verbs carefully—*file, post, mark, screen, record,* and *report,* for example. Use the sentence structure and context to eliminate ambiguity.

### Use contractions

Write using the same, everyday words you use in conversation.

* Use common contractions, such as *it’s, you’re, that's,* and *don’t,* to create a friendly, informal tone.
* Don't mix contractions and their spelled-out equivalents in UI text. For example, don’t use *can’t* and *cannot* in the same UI.
* Never form a contraction from a noun and a verb, such as *Microsoft’s developing a lot of new cloud services.*
* Avoid ambiguous or awkward contractions, such as *there’d, it’ll,* and *they’d.*

### Use technical terms carefully and consistently

Sometimes everyday words are given new meanings, like *cloud, batch,* or *dashboard*. Over time, some technical terms become widely understood, but before that happens, they can be confusing to people who aren't familiar with them. Use technical terms when they're the clearest way to communicate your message, but use them with care.

Here are technical terminology resources to check:

* [Glossary](glossary.md)
* [*The American Heritage Dictionary*](https://ahdictionary.com/).
* [W3C](https://www.w3.org/standards/xml)
* [IEEE](https://www.ieee.org/index.html).
* *[PMI Lexicon of Project Management Terms](https://www.pmi.org/PMBOK-Guide-and-Standards/PMI-lexicon.aspx)*
* [FDIC List of Abbreviations and Glossary of Terms (Appendix B)](https://www.fdic.gov/bank/historical/managing/documents/history-consolidated.pdf).

## What not to do

### Don’t create a new term

Don't create a new term if an existing one serves your purpose. If you must create a new term, verify that it isn’t already being used to mean something else.

Most people know the common definition of words. Use words in the most familiar sense, or define them if you can’t. Be careful with common words that have industry-specific uses. Assume customers know the common definition of the word, not the industry-specific definition. If you must use the industry-specific definition, define the word in context.

|                   Situation                    |                 Example                  |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Don’t create a new word from an existing word. | Don’t use *bucketize* to mean *group.*   |
| Don't apply a new meaning to an ordinary word. | Don’t use *graveyard* to mean *archive.* |

### Don’t use verbs as nouns or nouns as verbs

|      **Use this**      |    **Not this**    |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ |
| open an invitation     | open an invite     |
| affect performance     | impact performance |
| download the paper     | get the download   |
| respond to the request | respond to the ask |

## Jargon

Jargon is the technical terminology or characteristic idiom of a special activity or group. Differentiating jargon from technical terminology is tricky. First, check the [Glossary](glossary.md). If you don’t find the term, the following checklist can help.

* If you think a term is jargon, it probably is.
* If it’s an acronym or abbreviation, it may be jargon. Spell it out for clarity.
* If a reviewer questions your use of a term, it may be jargon.
* If the term is used in *The Wall Street Journal* or *The New York Times,* or in general-interest magazines, such as *Time* or *Newsweek,* it might be appropriate for some audiences.
* If the term is used in technical periodicals such as *CNET* or *Recode,* it's probably OK to use for technical audiences.

### Avoid jargon

Don’t use jargon if:

* You can use a more familiar term, such as *symbol* instead of *glyph.*
* The term is familiar to only a small segment of your readers.
* The term isn't specific to software, networking, cloud services, and so on.

Avoid business, marketing, and journalistic jargon, such as using *leverage* to mean *take advantage of.*
