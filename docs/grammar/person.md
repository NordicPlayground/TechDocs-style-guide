# Person

In grammar, "person" refers to the point of view represented by a statement and determines which pronoun to use. We primarily use second person.

In second person, you write as though you're speaking to the reader. Second person often uses the personal pronoun "you", but sometimes the word "you" is implied. Remove "you can" whenever the sentence works without it.

* e.g. Create your own unique Lumia experience.
* e.g. You can set advanced options later if you need them.

## Use first person sparingly

Use first person (usually "I" or "me") only when you need to write from the point of view of the customer.

* e.g. Alert me when a new Bluetooth device tries to connect to my computer. (check box text)

## Avoid first-person plural

Generally avoid first-person plural as it sounds like a daunting corporate presence. It's OK to use phrasing like "we recommend" if it helps you avoid awkward phrasing like "it's recommended", but try to rephrase the sentence when possible. Keep the focus on the customer, not Nordic.

**Use:** "The scheduled default setting is the easiest way to keep your computer up to date."

**Instead of:** "We recommend that you use the scheduled default setting ...."
