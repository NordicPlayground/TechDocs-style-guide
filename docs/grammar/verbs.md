# Verbs

Using the present tense is often easier to read and understand than the past or future tense. In the present tense, the action is happening now.

Use either the indicative or imperative form and avoid using the subjunctive form. These are crisp and straightforward without being bossy. Don’t switch moods within a sentence.

| **Mood** | **Use for** | **Examples** |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| **Indicative**  | Statements of fact, questions, assertions, and explanations. | Style sheets are powerful tools for formatting complex documents. |
| **Imperative**  | Instructions, procedures, direct commands, requests, and headings for columns that list customer actions. | Enter a file name, and then save the file.<br />To do this </br> Select this |
| **Subjunctive** | Wishes, hypotheses, and suggestions— **avoid** . | We recommend that you be careful about opening email attachments. |

## Active and passive voice

Use the active voice whenever you can. In active voice, the subject of the sentence performs the action. In passive voice, the subject is the receiver of the action.

|  **Voice**  |**Examples**|
| ----------- | ---------- |
| **Active**  | Office 365 includes the Office 2016 apps for PC and Mac. |
| **Passive** | When the user clicks **OK**, the transaction is committed. |

## Verb agreement

Verbs have singular and plural forms. Use the verb form that agrees with the subject of the sentence in number.


| **When the subject is** | **The verb is** | **Examples** |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A group of things | Singular | A variety of games **is** available from Microsoft Store.|
| Two or more singular things connected by "and" | Plural | Facebook and Twitter **are** available from Microsoft Store.|
| Two or more singular things connected by "or"| Singular| Your tablet or phone **is** all you need to play your favorite games on the go.|
| A singular thing and a plural thing connected by "or" | Singular or plural, to match the closest subject | Skype or social media apps **are** available from Microsoft Store.|
