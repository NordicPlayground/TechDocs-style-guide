# Grammar tips

Content that’s easy to read tends to be easy to localize and translate. This helps both machine translations and customers.

## Use American English and avoid non-English words

Nordic uses American English grammar and spelling. For example, use *license,* not *licence.*

* Avoid non-English words or phrases, such as *de facto* or *ad hoc*.
* Avoid Latin abbreviations for common English phrases.
* **Exception** It’s OK to use *etc.,* in situations where space is limited.

| **Use this** | **Instead of this** |
|--------------|---------------------|
| for example  |        e.g.         |
|   that is    |        i.e.         |
|    namely    |        viz.         |
|  therefore   |        ergo         |

### Avoid idioms and expressions

Avoid idioms, colloquial expressions, and culture-specific references. They can be confusing or not relatable for non-native English speakers and hard to localize.

### Use only common abbreviations

Use only common abbreviations, such as *USB*, and abbreviations that are defined in glossaries. Do not use internal or Nordic-specific abbreviations that are not commonly used in the industry.

## Use active voice and indicative mood

Use active voice and indicative mood most of the time. Use imperative mood in procedures.

## Include verbs in short headings

If necessary for clarity, include verbs in short headings and UI labels.

* E.g. *Access is denied* instead of *Access denied.*

## Keep adjectives and adverbs close to the words they modify

Pay particular attention to the placement of *only.*

## Include *that* and *who*

They help to clarify the sentence structure.

* E.g. Inspect the database to verify **that** all tables, data, and relationships were correctly migrated.
* E.g. Select the check box of each folder **that** you want to sync with your desktop.

## Include articles, such as *the*

Articles help readers and translation software identify the nouns and modifiers in a sentence.

* E.g. Empty **the** container.
* E.g. **The** empty container.

## Words ending in *–ing*

Use words ending in *–ing* carefully. A word ending in *–ing* can be a verb, an adjective, or a noun. Use the sentence structure and optional words to clarify the role of the *–ing* word.

## Words ending in *–ed*

Use words ending in *–ed* carefully. A word ending in *-ed* can be a modifier or part of a verb phrase. Use the sentence structure and optional words to clarify the role of the *–ed* word.

| Situation | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| Add a determiner (*a, an, the, this*) before or after the *–ed* word. | They have **an** added functionality.|
| Add a form of the verb *be*. | Configure limits for the backup **that are based** on the amount of storage space available. |
| Split the sentence in two. | Configure limits for the backup. These limits should be based on the amount of storage space available.|
| Rewrite the sentence to avoid the *–ed* word. | Configure limits for the backup. **Base the limits** on the amount of storage space available. |

## Use contractions

Write using the same, everyday words you use in conversation.

* Use common contractions, such as *it’s, you’re, that's,* and *don’t,* to create a friendly, informal tone.
* Don't mix contractions and their spelled-out equivalents in UI text. For example, don’t use *can’t* and *cannot* in the same UI.
* Never form a contraction from a noun and a verb, such as *Microsoft’s developing a lot of new cloud services.*
* Avoid ambiguous or awkward contractions, such as *there’d, it’ll,* and *they’d.*

## Nouns and verbs

Be careful with words that can be both nouns and verbs such as *file, post, mark, screen, record,* and *report.* Use the sentence structure and context to eliminate ambiguity.

### Don’t use verbs as nouns or nouns as verbs

Similar to words that can be both nouns and verbs, do not use verbs as nouns or visa versa. This can be confusing to both users and machine translation.

|      **Use this**      |    **Not this**    |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ |
| open an invitation     | open an invite     |
| affect performance     | impact performance |
| download the paper     | get the download   |
| respond to the request | respond to the ask |

## Avoid modifier stacks

Long chains of modifying words are confusing to read.

| Do this | Not this |
|---------|----------|
| "Your migration will proceed more smoothly if you have a project plan that's well thought out."| "With an extremely well thought-out migration project plan, your migration will go more smoothly." |

## Don't use unnecessary adverbs

Don't use unnecessary adverbs—words that describe how, when, or where. Unless they're important to the meaning of a statement, leave them out.

Examples:

* quite
* very
* quickly
* easily
* effectively
