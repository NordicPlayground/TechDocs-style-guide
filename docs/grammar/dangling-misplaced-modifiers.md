# Dangling and misplaced modifiers

Modifiers are single words or phrases that modify other words or phrases.

* A dangling modifier doesn’t modify anything in the sentence.
* A misplaced modifier is too far from the thing it modifies or too near to something else that it could modify.

Position a modifier to make it clear what it modifies. If you keep sentences short and simple and use active voice, you probably won’t run into dangling or misplaced modifiers.

## Good examples

| **Example** | **Meaning** |
|---|---|
| Only the selected text is deleted. | Nothing other than the selected text is deleted. |
| There are files **that can’t be removed** on the disk. | The phrase **that can’t be removed** modifies **the files.** This sentence clearly explains that the files can’t be removed, and they are on the disk. |

## Bad examples

| **Example** | **Meaning** |
|---|---|
| The selected text **only** is deleted. | **Only** could modify **is deleted** or **text**. This sentence could mean one of two things:<ul><li>The selected graphics aren't deleted.</li><li>The text is deleted but not archived.</li></ul> |
| There are files on the disk **that can’t be removed**. | The phrase **that can’t be removed** probably modifies **the disk**, but the writer may have intended to modify **files**. This sentence could mean one of two things:<ul><li>The files can’t be removed.</li><li>The disk can’t be removed. </li></ul> |
