# Prepositions

A prepositional phrase is a combination of a preposition and a noun that modifies or describes some part of a sentence.

In the sentence "The reading pane displays the content of the selected message.", the prepositional phrase, "of the selected message", describes the noun, "the content".

Avoid joining more than two prepositional phrases. Long chains of prepositional phrases are hard to read and easy to misinterpret.

## Preposition placement in a sentence

It's OK to end a sentence with a preposition when it improves readability.

* e.g. Use a different instrumentation key for each environment that your application runs in.
* e.g. Specify which event hub you want to send the data to.
